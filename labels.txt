20.444884	20.444884	By Gasman
22.181878	22.181878	(I thought
23.887574	23.887574	it would be
25.624568	25.624568	funny if I
27.392858	27.392858	used that)
29.133764	29.133764	Drop an apple
29.988568	29.988568	core
30.418905	30.418905	and it turns
31.226763	31.226763	into a woman
32.523640	32.523640	then she waves
33.200442	33.200442	her arms
33.873331	33.873331	tells you off
34.538396	34.538396	for dropping
35.206543	35.206543	litter
35.547730	35.547730	now she's got
36.088169	36.088169	some flappy
36.889597	36.889597	wings
37.398906	37.398906	is it Batman?
38.663756	38.663756	maybe
39.068663	39.068663	but she's
39.326001	39.326001	got a cup
40.050612	40.050612	of tea
40.754799	40.754799	oh my gosh
41.525492	41.525492	she's
42.073193	42.073193	dropped
42.550475	42.550475	it
43.017976	43.017976	Suddenly
43.612623	43.612623	the shard's a
44.520241	44.520241	flamenco dancer
46.022506	46.022506	saying "
46.499788	46.499788	"come and
46.891003	46.891003	'ave a go"
47.806445	47.806445	but look out
48.342409	48.342409	she's got
48.843164	48.843164	a dagger
49.519966	49.519966	and she nearly
50.364990	50.364990	had that poor
51.256959	51.256959	woman's eye
52.152841	52.152841	out
52.579265	52.579265	all she really
53.400816	53.400816	wanted
53.858538	53.858538	was to
54.288874	54.288874	show
54.756376	54.756376	off her
55.194536	55.194536	christ
55.589663	55.589663	christmas

56.880672	56.880672	wave a
57.354042	57.354042	massive sword
58.242099	58.242099	at a tadpole
59.061694	59.061694	in the sky
60.000610	60.000610	but it swims
60.606992	60.606992	out of the way
61.694569	61.694569	well
61.952771	61.952771	in that case
62.570891	62.570891	nevermind
63.463838	63.463838	and there's
63.815932	63.815932	suddenly a
64.754847	64.754847	tree
65.196920	65.196920	and a
65.615520	65.615520	woman
66.055636	66.055636	with a fan
66.912397	66.912397	and she flaps
67.503131	67.503131	it up and down
68.641566	68.641566	at a petal
69.494414	69.494414	in the air
70.395186	70.395186	but it's actually
71.521885	71.521885	a boat
72.163477	72.163477	and the woman
73.028061	73.028061	in the boat
73.900470	73.900470	has a
74.315158	74.315158	bloody massive
75.089763	75.089763	scythe
75.633552	75.633552	the grim reaper
76.459015	76.459015	in a dress
77.382282	77.382282	now it cuts
78.016050	78.016050	the screen
78.442474	78.442474	in     
78.657642	78.657642	   half
79.131012	79.131012	aren't those
79.522227	79.522227	earrings
79.933002	79.933002	really big?
80.797587	80.797587	look at me!!
81.447003	81.447003	i've got a
82.014265	82.014265	sword
82.581526	82.581526	now i'll point
83.027511	83.027511	it over
83.833413	83.833413	<------- there
84.300915	84.300915	and this girl
84.942507	84.942507	is so
85.400229	85.400229	depressed
86.022260	86.022260	that she set
86.675589	86.675589	her wrists
87.070716	87.070716	on fire
87.786639	87.786639	and is going
88.623838	88.623838	to set fire
89.543193	89.543193	to the ribbon
90.372568	90.372568	in her hair
91.342781	91.342781	but at least
91.929603	91.929603	we're nice
92.344291	92.344291	and warm
93.036741	93.036741	and i think
93.607914	93.607914	this girl
94.096933	94.096933	agrees
94.761998	94.761998	but
94.934133	94.934133	i don't
95.321435	95.321435	know why
95.802629	95.802629	they're dressed
96.444222	96.444222	as a
96.905855	96.905855	pot plant
97.355752	97.355752	and a
97.764571	97.764571	bull
98.257502	98.257502	there's a funny
99.082965	99.082965	glowing ball
99.971023	99.971023	and i wonder
100.765189	100.765189	what it is
101.708016	101.708016	doesn't want
102.333960	102.333960	to shake
102.736911	102.736911	my hand
103.413713	103.413713	well
103.650398	103.650398	i'm so
103.998579	103.998579	offended now
105.176135	105.176135	and this girl
105.833376	105.833376	is sulking
106.459320	106.459320	too
106.905305	106.905305	but she's having
107.777714	107.777714	second thoughts
108.669683	108.669683	and she wishes
109.499059	109.499059	that she'd
109.935263	109.935263	gone to the
110.804738	110.804738	party
111.246810	111.246810	on the sun

127.690545	127.690545	sweep them up
128.517965	128.517965	now
128.934608	128.934608	wait a minute
129.857875	129.857875	maybe if i

150.715491	150.715491	right past
151.138003	151.138003	the next
151.955642	151.955642	girl

155.067755	155.067755	wings
155.498091	155.498091	write a letter
156.135771	156.135771	of complaint
157.237041	157.237041	but the
157.636080	157.636080	pen runs
158.015558	158.015558	out of
158.520225	158.520225	ink
158.887967	158.887967	so she
159.365249	159.365249	throws it
159.811234	159.811234	like a
160.233746	160.233746	dart
160.707116	160.707116	and a viking
161.534535	161.534535	takes a drink
162.461714	162.461714	from this
162.864666	162.864666	sort of
163.291090	163.291090	violin
164.190884	164.190884	but
164.374755	164.374755	some bugger
165.043732	165.043732	drank the rest
165.916141	165.916141	and there's
166.303443	166.303443	hardly
166.763121	166.763121	any left
167.666827	167.666827	and the droplet
168.519675	168.519675	is a girl
169.431205	169.431205	with a creepy
170.248844	170.248844	little doll
171.132990	171.132990	but
171.359894	171.359894	she's got ADHD
172.913017	172.913017	and forgot
173.492015	173.492015	to take
173.947780	173.947780	her pills
174.630450	174.630450	now the doll
175.221184	175.221184	has got
175.694554	175.694554	away
176.379180	176.379180	and she's
176.739097	176.739097	running for
177.666276	177.666276	a bus
178.131822	178.131822	but she trips
178.789063	178.789063	over a
179.332851	179.332851	shoe    
179.841431	179.841431	shoelace and
180.275679	180.275679	falls     
180.494759	180.494759	falls in  
180.733400	180.733400	falls into
180.913359	180.913359	the sea
181.590161	181.590161	and it's
182.020497	182.020497	really windy
182.904642	182.904642	now
183.323242	183.323242	this umbrella's
184.191739	184.191739	going to break
185.111093	185.111093	but it's really
185.952205	185.952205	not the wind
186.836351	186.836351	there's a

191.304023	191.304023	a hat
191.980825	191.980825	and if you
192.610681	192.610681	don't think
193.025368	193.025368	it suits
193.698258	193.698258	her
193.921250	193.921250	she'll
194.132506	194.132506	chop off
194.558930	194.558930	both your
195.036212	195.036212	legs
